I don't remember who wrote script mark-yank-urls,
if you know, tell me. I just rewrote urlopen script
in perl and added support for http://psto.net/.

Installation:
---------------
First add lines to your ~/.Xdefaults from .Xdefaults,
then copy urlopen and mark-yank-urls to /usr/local/bin
and make it executable.
